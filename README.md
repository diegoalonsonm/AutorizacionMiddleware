## Overview

**AutorizacionMiddleware** is a C# project designed to simplify the implementation of authorization logic in applications, allowing you to control access to resources and operations in a centralized and flexible way.

This middleware can be easily integrated into .NET applications to check permissions, roles, or any custom authorization criteria before allowing the execution of certain actions. This improves security and keeps your code organized.

## Main Features

- Easy implementation as middleware in .NET applications.
- Define custom authorization rules.
- Manage user permissions and roles.
- Centralize access control logic, preventing code duplication in controllers and services.
- Modular and extensible for different types of applications.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET (version according to project configuration)

## Usage

Add the middleware to your application's pipeline and configure authorization rules as needed for your project.

```csharp
// Example integration (add your own logic as defined in the project)
app.UseMiddleware<AutorizacionMiddleware>();
```
